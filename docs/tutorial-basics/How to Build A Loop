Looping and Iteration States
Looping State
One of the easiest ways to introduce a loop into an application process is to use a LoopingState. This is a type of state that will execute actions repeatedly until till either a count is reached or the Completed flag variable is set.

To use a looping state drag a Looping State symbol from the States section of the Palette and connect up. The Execute event runs each time around the loop decrementing LoopCount until it reaches zero. You can set up LoopCount to an initial value by passing in a value from an action, using an Assign, using EL (Expression language) or, for a fixed loop, by using an input parameter. 

You can get to the parameters dialog either by using the Parameters property field on the Properties pane or by holding down the shift key and double-clicking the Inputs label on the symbol. In the example below we are specifying a fixed loop count of 5:
