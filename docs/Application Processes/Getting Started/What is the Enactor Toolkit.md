# What is the Enactor Toolkit?

The Enactor Toolkit is an advanced and powerful set of Visual Development Tools that enable IT teams easily to visualise, understand and change the Data Structures, User Interfaces and Processes represented in software that span a commercial enterprise. In particular, Visual ***Process Design Editors*** at both the Application and Business Process levels abstract the Process Flows of a potentially large and cumbersome code base allowing Designers, Developers and Business Analysts to readily apprehend and control the overall flow of an Application or System. 

## Who is the Toolkit for?

Both technical and non-technical professionals alike may interpret and understand the high-level logic of Processes represented in the Process Editors, thereby providing a foundation for discussion of change requirements in a design representation context that ***is*** the application. The Design Elements represented in the Enactor Tools design editors are the same elements used at build and runtime to implement applications and systems.

## What makes up the Enactor Toolkit?

The ***Wizards, Editors and Design Tools*** provide the primary interface to design Applications using the Enactor Toolkit and are directly available for use in Eclipse. The Classes and Superclasses of the ***Enactor Platform*** provide a foundation of built-in software elements and the ***Runtime Framework*** runs the application, using the element definitions of the design at Runtime to execute the application. The ***Resource Library*** is a rich library of reusable Design Resources. In addition to all the Design elements created by the Designer and any other Design Resources available in other Projects in the Workspace, the library includes numerous ready-made and built-in Design Resources provided by the Enactor Tools and Platform.
